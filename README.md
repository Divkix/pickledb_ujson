# **pickleDB: Your Lightweight, High-Speed Key-Value Store**

### âœ… **Blazing Speed**
Backed by the high-performance [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) library, pickleDB handles millions of records with ease. Perfect for applications where every millisecond counts.

### âœ… **Ridiculously Easy to Use**
With its minimalist API, pickleDB makes adding, retrieving, and managing your data as simple as writing a Python list. No steep learning curves. No unnecessary complexity.

### âœ… **Rock-Solid Reliability**
Your data deserves to be safe. Atomic saves ensure your database remains consistentâ€”even if something goes wrong.

### âœ… **Pythonic Flexibility**
Store strings, lists, dictionaries, and moreâ€”all with native Python operations. No need to learn special commands. If you know Python, you already know pickleDB.

### âœ… **Async Support**
Use pickleDB's `AsyncPickleDB` class for async operations and saves made possible with aiofiles. Ready to go for use with web frameworks like Starlette, FastAPI, and [MicroPie](https://patx.github.io/micropie).

### ðŸ’¡ **Getting Started**
Check out pickleDB's [website](https://patx.github.io/pickledb) for a [user guide](https://patx.github.io/pickledb/guide) complete with advanced examples and the complete [API documentation](https://patx.github.io/pickledb/commands).


## **Performance Highlights**

pickleDB demonstrates strong performance for handling large-sized datasets:

| Entries      | Memory Load Time | Retrieval Time | Save Time |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **1M**       | 1.21 sec         | 0.90 sec       | 0.17 sec  |
| **10M**      | 14.11 sec        | 10.30 sec      | 1.67 sec  |
| **50M**      | 93.79 sec        | 136.42 sec     | 61.08 sec |

Tests were performed on a StarLabs StarLite Mk IV (Quad-Core IntelÂ® PentiumÂ® Silver N5030 CPU @ 1.10GHz w/ 8GB memory) running elementary OS 7.1 Horus.

## **Limitations**

While pickleDB is powerful, itâ€™s important to understand its limitations:

- **Memory Usage**: The entire dataset is loaded into memory, which might be a constraint on systems with limited RAM for extremely large datasets.
- **Single-Threaded**: The program is not thread-safe by default. For concurrent access, use the async class `AsyncPickleDB`.
- **Blocking Saves**: Saves are blocking by default. To achieve non-blocking saves, use the `AsyncPickleDB` class.
- **Lack of Advanced Features**: pickleDB is designed for simplicity, so it may not meet the needs of applications requiring advanced database features.

For projects requiring more robust solutions, consider alternatives like **[kenobiDB](Https://github.com/patx/kenobi)**, [Redis](http://redis.io/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/), or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
